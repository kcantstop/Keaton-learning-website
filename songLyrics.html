<h1><strong>Have You Ever Seen the Rain</strong></h1>

<p>Someone told me long ago</p>
<p>There's a calm before the storm I know</p>
<p>It's been comin' for some time</p>
<p>When it's over, so they say</p>
<p>It'll rain a sunny day, I know</p>
<p>Shining down like water</p>
<p><em>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p>Comin' down on a sunny day?</p>
<p>Yesterday, and days before</p>
<p>Sun is cold and rain is hot I know</p>
<p>Been that way for all my time</p>
<p>Till forever, on it goes</p>
<p>Through the circle, fast and slow I know</p>
<p>It can't stop, I wonder</p>
<p><em>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p>Comin' down on a sunny day?</p>
<p><em>Yeah!, I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</em></p>
<p>Comin' down on a sunny day?</p>
